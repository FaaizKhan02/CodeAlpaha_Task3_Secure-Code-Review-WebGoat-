This is the main vulnerability table — it lists each detected issue from your spotbugsXml.xml file.
For example:

#	File / Class	Vulnerability Type	Severity	Description	Recommendation
1	AsciiDoctorTemplateResolver.java	Reliance on Default Encoding	High	Uses system default character encoding which may cause inconsistent data handling.	Specify StandardCharsets.UTF_8.
2	VulnerableTaskHolder.java	Resource Leak	Medium	Input streams not properly closed, leading to resource leaks.	Use try-with-resources.
3	AttackResult.java	Mutable Object Exposure	Medium	Mutable arrays are returned directly.	Return cloned arrays or immutable objects.
4	EnvironmentExposure.java	Static Field Written by Instance Method	High	Instance methods modify static fields (thread safety issue).	Avoid shared mutable static fields.
5	DatabaseConfiguration.java	Internal Representation Exposure	Medium	Mutable configuration objects shared externally.	Return deep copies.
6	WebSecurityConfig.java	Mutable Object Return	Medium	Service object returned, can be modified externally.	Use dependency injection safely.
